# Minimax inequality and saddle-points

Let $f:X\times Y \rightarrow \mathbb R$ be a function. The *minimax* inequality states that:

$$\inf_{x\in X}\sup_{y\in Y}f(x,y)\ge\sup_{y\in Y}\inf_{x\in X}f(x,y)$$

The proof is simple. For all $x'\in X,y'\in Y$,

$$\inf_{x\in X}f(x,y')\le f(x',y')\le\sup_{y\in Y}f(x',y)$$

by the definitions of $\inf$ and $\sup$. Since these inequalities hold for all $x'\in X,y'\in Y$, they still hold if we take the $\inf$ w.r.t. $x'$ and the $\sup$ w.r.t. to $y'$. Dropping the primes from the dummy variables $x',y'$ we recover the minimax inequality, as desired.

Note that this proof, depends critically on the assumption that the domain of $f$ is a Cartesian product, $\mathrm{dom} \, f = X \times Y$. If this assumption is relaxed, the minimax inequality need not hold. We investigate this further in a second note.

## Saddle-points

A point $x_0\in X,y_0 \in Y$ satisfying:

$$f\left(x_{0},y\right)\le f\left(x_{0},y_{0}\right)\le f\left(x,y_{0}\right)$$

for all $x\in X,y\in Y$ is called a **saddle point** of $f$. If $x_0,y_0$ is a saddle-point, then

$$
\inf_{x\in X}\sup_{y\in Y}f\left(x,y\right)\le\inf_{x\in X}f\left(x,y_{0}\right)=f\left(x_{0},y_{0}\right)
$$

$$
\sup_{y\in Y}\inf_{x\in X}f\left(x,y\right)\ge\sup_{y\in Y}f\left(x_{0},y\right)=f\left(x_{0},y_{0}\right)
$$

Together with the minimax inequality, this implies the *minimax equality*,

$$\sup_{x\in X}\inf_{y \in Y} f(x,y) = \inf_{y\in Y}\sup_{x \in X} f(x,y)$$

Moreover, notice that $f(x_0,y_0)$ has been sandwiched and therefore equals the result of both extremizations. This holds for *all* saddle points, because the extremizations made no reference to a particular saddle-point. Therefore all saddle-points produce the same value of $f$.

Thus, the existence of a saddle-point guarantees that the minimax inequality becomes an equality. What about the converse? The minimax equality implies existence of saddle-points? The answer is Yes, as we will see, but only if a $f$ satisfies a technical condition.

Suppose that there exist $x_0\in X, y_0 \in Y$ such that $x_0$ is a maximizer of $\inf_{y \in Y} f(x,y)$ and $y_0$ a minimizer of $\sup_{x \in X} f(x,y)$. For example, if $f(x,y)$ is continuous and $X,Y$ compact, then $x_0,y_0$ are guaranteed to exist. Then,

$$ \begin{aligned}
  \sup_{x \in X} \inf_{y \in Y} f(x,y) = \inf_{y \in Y} f(x_0, y) &\le f(x_0, y_0) \\
  \inf_{y \in Y} \sup_{x \in X} f(x,y) = \sup_{x \in X} f(x, y_0) &\ge f(x_0, y_0) \\
\end{aligned} $$

Hence, if the minimax equality holds, $x_0,y_0$ is a saddle-point.

Therefore the existence of a saddle-point is a necessary and sufficient condition for the minimax equality to hold, provided $f(x,y)$ is "smooth" enough to guarantee the existence of the extremizer values $x_0,y_0$. For example, a sufficient condition for the equivalence between exsitence of saddle-points and the minimax equality, is that $f$ is continuous and $X,Y$ compact.

Suppose that $x_0,y_0$ is a saddle-point of a differentiable function $f(x,y)$. Then $x_0$ is a minimizer of $f(x,y_0)$ with respect to $x$, and $y_0$ is a maximizer of $f(x_0,y)$ with respect to $y$. Hence

$$\left.\frac{\partial f}{\partial x}\right|_{(x_0,y_0)} = \left.\frac{\partial f}{\partial y}\right|_{(x_0,y_0)} = 0$$

Therefore saddle-points of differentiable functions are critical points.
